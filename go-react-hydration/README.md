# What's Hydration?

Hydration is the process of attaching JavaScript event handlers and state to server-rendered HTML. When using React with Go SSR, the server first renders the React components to static HTML and sends it to the client. Then, React on the client-side "hydrates" this HTML by adding all the necessary event handlers and making it interactive. This provides the best of both worlds - fast initial page loads from SSR and full interactivity from client-side React.

# Why Go SSR Hydration with React instead of Next.js?

While Next.js provides an excellent React SSR solution, using Go for SSR with React has several advantages:

- Better performance - Go is extremely fast at rendering HTML
- More control over the server implementation
- Leverage Go's strong ecosystem for backend functionality
- Easier integration with existing Go services
- No JavaScript runtime needed on the server
- Simpler deployment without Node.js dependencies

# Hydration Rules & Best Practices

To ensure smooth hydration when using Go SSR with React:

1. Match server and client render output exactly
2. Use stable IDs and keys
3. Avoid setting initial state during hydration
4. Handle loading states appropriately
5. Keep component hierarchy consistent
6. Minimize JavaScript bundle size
7. Use streaming SSR when possible
8. Test hydration in development mode

# Hydration Mismatch Errors

Common hydration mismatch errors and solutions:

- Text content mismatch: Ensure server and client render the same text
- Attribute differences: Check for dynamic attributes/props
- Component structure mismatch: Keep DOM hierarchy identical
- Missing/extra nodes: Verify conditional rendering logic
- Event handler issues: Confirm proper event binding
- State inconsistency: Initialize state correctly
