Route 53 is the DNS web service of AWS. You can set various DNS records (like A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) for your domains just like other DNS providers such as Cloudflare and GoDaddy. It offers additional features including domain registration, health checking, traffic routing policies (like latency-based, geolocation, and failover routing), and tight integration with other AWS services.
