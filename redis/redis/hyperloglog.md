HyperLogLog is a special data type in Redis that estimates the number of unique elements (cardinality) in a set with an error rate of about 0.81%. What's great about HyperLogLog is that regardless of how much data you enter into the key, it always uses a small fixed memory size of just 12 KB per key. This makes it extremely memory efficient for counting distinct elements in very large datasets.

You can add elements, get the count, and merge HyperLogLog keys by using the commands `PFADD`, `PFCOUNT`, and `PFMERGE`:
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> PFADD hll a b c d e f g h
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> PFCOUNT hll
(integer) 8
127.0.0.1:6379> PFADD hll2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> PFCOUNT hll2
(integer) 8
127.0.0.1:6379> PFMERGE merged_hll hll hll2
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> PFCOUNT merged_hll
(integer) 16
127.0.0.1:6379> PFCOUNT hll hll2 merged_hll
(integer) 16
```
