# Microservice in Go

This project is a learning exercise focused on the fundamentals of microservice architecture using Golang. It also explores essential technologies commonly used in microservice-based systems, such as service discovery, message brokers, telemetry, and gRPC for service-to-service communication.

The project is not 100% complete, but it covers the key concepts I aimed to learn. Below is an overview of the project architecture:
